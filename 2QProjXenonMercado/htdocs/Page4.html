				<h1>World Of Children</h1>
				<p>The world of children Organization began in 1996 when its co-founder, Harry Leibowitz who recovering from cancer at the time, had an epiphany when he saw there were no awards for organizations that tirelessly work and help children. It helps children's futures by funding different people and organizations that strive for changes in the lives of these disadvantaged children. They have "dedicated more than $15 million to high-impact programs for children, led by nearly 130 Honorees working in over 70 countries".</p>

				<h1>Global Fund For Children</h1>
				<p>The Global Fund For Children is a non-profit organization that works and funds organizations. It first tries to find an innovative organization that helps children, it then funds and mentors that organization and connects it to its partners and other organization until it becomes stable enough to stand on its own. It has helped over 11 million children and has “invested 56 million dollars in more than 1,000 community-based organizations”.</p>
